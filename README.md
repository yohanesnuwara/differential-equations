`ode-to-joy` is a package that consists collection of ordinary differential equations (ODE) numerical solvers using Python. Name of `ode-to-joy` is taken from Ludwig van Beethoven's musical masterpiece "Ode to Joy". 

ODE is an important subject to engineering students, and numerical ODE solver is useful to solve most ODEs that appear in engineering problems. Below is the list of available solvers:
* Euler
* Modified Euler
* Midpoint
* Ralston
* Heun
* Runge-Kutta 3rd, 4th, 5th order
